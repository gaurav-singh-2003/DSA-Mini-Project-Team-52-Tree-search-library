# DSA-Mini-Project-Team-52-Tree-search-library
1.  The idea behind Tree Search Library is that, once given the 'comparator' function between nodes by 
    the user, the library can use this to perform any kind of search by the change of just one function.
2. The comparator function takes as input the pointers of two nodes and outputs whether the first is 
    lesser than the other. You can use this comparator for deciding the order of 2 nodes in the priority 
    queue.
## Instructions to Use the library
1. A sample main.c file is provided which shows how the file can be used. 
2. Run make to compile the code to genereate the tree_lib file which can be used.
